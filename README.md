# MST-in-Parallel
A minimum Spanning Tree coded for parallel in Java

This paper will attempt to create an optimal parallelised Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) in Java. After a short literature review an algorithm will be selected for the MST design and implemented iteratively. Timing results will be obtained by running the Java program on the University of Manchesterâ€™s mcore48 machine. The resulting values including speedup will be analysed for a greater understanding of the problematic overheads limiting execution time reduction.
